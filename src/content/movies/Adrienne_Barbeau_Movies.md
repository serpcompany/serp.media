In "Burial of the Rats, " a young Bram Stoker finds himself ensnared in the dangerous grip of a radical all-female cult that worships the flesh-devouring rats and practices sexism in a seemingly misogynistic manner. The warrior women of this secret society punish evil men and raid their lairs with ruthless precision, guided by their grotesque rats. Our protagonist is left with an agonizing choice: escape the cult and leave behind the woman he loves wholeheartedly or succumb to the allure of their twisted rituals. This macabre blend of adventure, fantasy, and horror unfolds against the backdrop of 19th century France and challenges conventional notions of power, sexuality, and matriarchal rule. Will Bram Stoker find the strength to break free, or will he be swallowed by the cult's twisted world of rats, weapons, and forbidden love?
