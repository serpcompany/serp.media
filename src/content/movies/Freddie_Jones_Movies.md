The Libertine" (2004) is a captivating drama that follows the life of John Wilmot, the Earl of Rochester, a 17th century poet whose wild and debauched lifestyle ultimately led to an untimely death. Far from the prudish moral standards of the time, Rochester was renowned for his public nudity, penchant for scantily-clad women, and an insatiable lust for life. The film, directed by Laurence Dunmore and written by Stephen Jeffreys, gives viewers a thrilling glimpse into the scandalous world of Rochester, an artist whose life served as a breeding ground for creativity.
