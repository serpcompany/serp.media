Wicked Little Letters (2023), directed by Thea Sharrock and written by Jonny Sweet, is a hilarious comedy-crime-drama set in the seaside town of Littlehampton during the 1920s. When the townspeople, including the conservative local Edith, start receiving letters filled with crude, hilariously profane messages, the rowdy Irish migrant Rose is accused of sending them.
