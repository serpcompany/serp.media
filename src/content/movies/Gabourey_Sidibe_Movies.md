In "Black Barbie: A Documentary, " love her or hate her, nearly everyone has a Barbie story - the iconic American brand that has left an indelible mark on generations of young girls and boys. This film, however, delves deep into a story seldom heard: that of the first Black Barbie. Directed by Lagueria Davis, the movie is based on the recollections of the filmmaker's 83-year old aunt, Beulah Mae Mitchell, and a simple question, "Why not make a Barbie that is. . ? ". The film masterfully weaves together the threads of history, celebrity interviews, cultural commentary, and personal insights to reveal a fascinating tale about the impact of Barbie beyond the plastic.
