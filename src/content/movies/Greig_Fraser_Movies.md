Dune" is a high-octane, epic science fiction adventure brought to life by acclaimed director Denis Villeneuve. In a world where political power struggles and mind control reign supreme, protagonist Paul Atreides (played by Timothée Chalamet, Oscar-winning director of "Call Me by Your Name") is the heir to a noble family's empire; but as power battles abound across the galaxy for the most precious resource of all - "the spice" - his visions of a dismal future disturb his mind. His mother, played by award-winning actress Rebecca Ferguson, stands by him in this intense battle amidst a backdrop of brutal combat and sandworm-infested landscapes.
