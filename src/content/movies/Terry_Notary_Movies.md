In the eerie small town of Meadowview, every year, a terrifying tradition begins - the rise of Sawtooth Jack, the mythical nightmare that emerges from the cornfields, targeting the town's teenage boys in a brutal, life-or-death struggle. As the young men face this vicious entity, friendships, loyalties, and the will to survive are put to the ultimate test. From Director David Slade and Writer Michael Gilio, "Dark Harvest" is a chilling, thrilling journey that explores the darkest corners of fantasy and horror.
