A Girl Like Her" is a gripping coming-of-age drama that explores the complex and dark side of high school life.

Directed by Amy S. Weber, this emotional film expertly captures the raw, painful nature of high school harassment, friendship, and betrayal through the use of a pseudo-documentary style.
