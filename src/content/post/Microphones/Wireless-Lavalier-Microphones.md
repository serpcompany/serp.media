<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/wireless-lavalier-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=wireless-lavalier-microphones&utm_term=alvoxcon-wireless-lapel-microphone-for-pc-computer-android-smartphone-laptop-speaker-size-small-blac-1"><img alt="alvoxcon-wireless-lapel-microphone-for-pc-computer-android-smartphone-laptop-speaker-size-small-blac-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/alvoxcon-wireless-lapel-microphone-for-pc-computer-android-smartphone-laptop-speaker-size-small-blac-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've been using this tiny USB wireless lapel microphone for a while now, and let me tell you, it's a game-changer for anyone who needs to record clear audio on their computer or smartphone. The rechargeable battery lasts for hours, so you don't have to worry about changing batteries while you're in the middle of a Zoom meeting or recording a podcast. 

One thing that really stood out to me was the 3.5mm AUX earphone Jack on the USB receiver. It lets me monitor the recording in real-time without any latency, and I can even connect it to a speaker that accepts AUX input to project the sound from the clip-on microphone. This little gadget has been so useful for my online meetings, school lectures, and video filming. 

The UHF DQPSK technology gives me the freedom to move around while performing or presenting, without worrying about radio interference. Plus, setting up the microphone is a breeze with its automatic frequency pairing feature. 

However, there are a couple of things you should keep in mind. First, make sure you only use one set of this microphone at a time, otherwise, there might be some interference. And second, it's not compatible with Facebook Live on phones, so you'll need to use a different app or device if that's what you're planning to do. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend this USB wireless lapel microphone for anyone who needs a reliable way to record high-quality audio on their computer or smartphone. It's easy to use, easy to set up, and has a small size that won't get in your way. Give it a try and see for yourself how much better your recordings can sound!

Plus, the 65-feet outdoor range ensured a stable connection with my phone, providing consistent sound quality. 

However, not everything was perfect with this microphone. Some users reported issues with the volume being too low, requiring them to hold the microphone close to their mouths for clear audio.
