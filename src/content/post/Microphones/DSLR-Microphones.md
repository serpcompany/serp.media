<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/dslr-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=dslr-microphones&utm_term=comica-cvm-ws60-combo-universal-wireless-mic-for-dslr-smartphones-1"><img alt="comica-cvm-ws60-combo-universal-wireless-mic-for-dslr-smartphones-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/comica-cvm-ws60-combo-universal-wireless-mic-for-dslr-smartphones-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a vlogger who's always on the go, I was thrilled to try out the Comica CVM-WS60 COMBO Wireless Mic. This little device packs a punch - it offers easy connectivity with most auxiliary devices, thanks to its 3.5mm jack. The LCD display also adds to its functionality and makes it easy to operate. 

One of the highlights for me was the anti-noise shielding system. It really helped to avert ambient sound while I was recording, making my videos sound crystal clear. However, one drawback I noticed was that the battery life wasn't quite as long as I'd hoped for, but this is manageable with spares or USB power. 

All in all, the Comica CVM-WS60 COMBO Wireless Mic is a game-changer for mobile journalists, videographers, and vloggers who need operational simplicity. With its clip-on lavalier microphones, bodypack transmitters, and adjustable smartphone clamp, it's a complete solution that offers interference-free signal quality and easy expansion into multisystem configurations.

### [Behringer Video Mic: A Professional Cardioid Condenser Microphone for Filmmakers and Creators](https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/dslr-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=dslr-microphones&utm_term=behringer-video-mic-a-professional-cardioid-condenser-microphone-for-filmmakers-and-creators)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/dslr-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=dslr-microphones&utm_term=behringer-video-mic-condenser-camera-microphone-1"><img alt="behringer-video-mic-condenser-camera-microphone-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/behringer-video-mic-condenser-camera-microphone-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Behringer VIDEO MIC is a compact powerhouse in camera microphones. As a cardioid condenser microphone, it's made to capture clear sounds, perfect for all your on-the-go videography needs. Its unidirectional pickup pattern ensures that the audio you record is as focused and crisp as your video. 

I've been using this microphone for a while now and it's been a game-changer. The build quality is top-notch, feeling far more premium than its price suggests. The shock mount and windshield included in the package have been incredibly useful in reducing unwanted noise during outdoor shoots. 

However, there are a couple of minor hiccups. The power supply using an external 1.5V source can be a pain to manage, especially if you're constantly on the move. Also, while the microphone itself is excellent, the mount could use some improvement. It tends to loosen up after a while, which can result in some unwanted noise if not fixed promptly. 

Overall, this camera microphone is a solid choice for anyone looking to upgrade their audio quality without breaking the bank. As long as you can manage the power supply and invest in a better mount, the Behringer VIDEO MIC is definitely worth considering.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/dslr-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=dslr-microphones&utm_term=ampridge-mightymic-slr-shotgun-dslr-video-microphone-1"><img alt="ampridge-mightymic-slr-shotgun-dslr-video-microphone-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/ampridge-mightymic-slr-shotgun-dslr-video-microphone-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a tech enthusiast always on the lookout for new gadgets, I recently got my hands on the Ampridge MightyMic SLR Shotgun DSLR Video Microphone. I've been using this compact condenser microphone with my DSLR camera and smartphone, and I must say, it's a game-changer! 

First off, I love how the MightyMic doesn't require any batteries. It's surprising how much better the sound quality is compared to my camera's built-in microphone. Plus, it's super easy to use; all I have to do is plug it into the headphone jack of my camera or phone, and I'm good to go! 

One standout feature of the MightyMic is its compatibility with various devices. Whether it's a DSLR camera, iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, or even a Samsung Galaxy device, this little microphone can handle it all. And if you're using an iOS device, you can even listen to the sound while recording video using the optional MoviePro App. 

On the downside, the sound quality isn't quite on par with a studio microphone, but for the price, it's definitely worth it. The only other con I've encountered is that the foam windscreen doesn't always stay in place, but a little tape fixes that issue quickly. 

Overall, I'm really happy with my purchase of the Ampridge MightyMic SLR Shotgun DSLR Video Microphone. It's made a significant difference in the sound quality of my videos, and I would recommend it to anyone in need of a high-quality, affordable microphone. 


### [Polaroid Professional DSLR Microphone with Sensitive Electret Condenser Technology](https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/dslr-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=dslr-microphones&utm_term=polaroid-professional-dslr-microphone-with-sensitive-electret-condenser-technology)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/dslr-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=dslr-microphones&utm_term=polaroid-professional-grade-digital-slr-and-camcorder-microphone-1"><img alt="polaroid-professional-grade-digital-slr-and-camcorder-microphone-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/polaroid-professional-grade-digital-slr-and-camcorder-microphone-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a professional photographer, I thought I'd give the Polaroid Professional Grade Digital SLR and Camcorder Microphone a spin to see if it could enhance my audio recordings. Right off the bat, I was impressed by how sensitive it is to low volume sources, thanks to its Electret Condenser Technology. This feature has proved incredibly useful when capturing subtle sounds during my street photography sessions. 

The Slide Shoe Mounting with Wheel Lock is another standout. It's sturdy and secure, guaranteeing that the microphone stays in place even during chaotic shoots. The battery life is impressive too, thanks to the lithium battery. 

However, there are some areas where improvement could be made. For instance, while the microphone does a good job of minimizing background noise with its Cardioid Pickup Pattern, it doesn't completely eliminate unwanted sounds. 

Also, the user selectable pickup angles - 90 or 120 degrees - could be more intuitive to use. Navigating through the settings can be a little confusing at first, especially in the midst of a shoot. 

All in all, the Polaroid Professional Grade Digital SLR and Camcorder Microphone is a competent tool, especially for capturing soft, low-level sounds. But there's definitely room for enhancement in terms of user experience and sound capture. 


### [Deco Gear Shotgun Microphone for DSLR Cameras](https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/dslr-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=dslr-microphones&utm_term=deco-gear-shotgun-microphone-for-dslr-cameras)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/dslr-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=dslr-microphones&utm_term=deco-gear-universal-mini-condenser-shotgun-microphone-for-digital-cameras-and-camcorders-1"><img alt="deco-gear-universal-mini-condenser-shotgun-microphone-for-digital-cameras-and-camcorders-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/deco-gear-universal-mini-condenser-shotgun-microphone-for-digital-cameras-and-camcorders-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently had the chance to use the Deco Gear Universal Mini Condenser Shotgun Microphone with my DSLR camera, and I have to say, it's been quite a game-changer. Before this, I was relying on the built-in microphone on my camera, which didn't always give me the best sound quality. 

The Deco Gear microphone has a uni-directional electret condenser that records in stereo, making my videos sound much more professional. I especially appreciated the detachable foam windscreen, which helped to cut down on wind noise and other unwanted sounds. The microphone was also easy to attach to my camera using the hot/cold shoe mount with a locking knob, making it stable and secure. 

Another great feature is the long battery life of approximately 800 hours at room temperature. I've been using it for weeks now and haven't had to change the battery yet. However, one downside is that the microphone does require a 3V CR2 lithium-ion battery, which isn't included in the package. 

Overall, I'm really happy with the Deco Gear Universal Mini Condenser Shotgun Microphone. It's made a significant difference in the quality of my videos, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to improve their audio recordings.

### How do I attach a DSLR microphone to my camera?

Check your microphone's specifications and your camera's compatibility to ensure proper attachment. 


### Do I need a separate power source for my DSLR microphone?

Many DSLR microphones run on battery power, either AA or AAA batteries or internal rechargeable batteries. Some microphones can also be powered via a USB connection from your camera or an external power source. Check your microphone's specifications to determine its power requirements and options.

* Position the microphone as close as possible to the audio source to capture the most direct sound waves.

* Use a windshield or windscreen on your microphone to reduce wind noise and plosives (harsh, explosive sounds caused by consonants like "p" and "b").

* Place your camera and microphone on a stable surface or use a tripod to minimize vibrations and handling noise.

* Consider using a separate sound mixer to further control and refine your audio quality.


### How do I maintain and care for my DSLR microphone?
