### [Crosley Red Portable Turntable with Bluetooth and Pitch Control](https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/pink-crosley-record-players?utm_source=serp.media&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=%40serpmedia&utm_content=pink-crosley-record-players&utm_term=crosley-red-portable-turntable-with-bluetooth-and-pitch-control)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/pink-crosley-record-players?utm_source=serp.media&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=%40serpmedia&amp;utm_content=pink-crosley-record-players&amp;utm_term=crosley-red-portable-turntable-with-bluetooth-and-pitch-control"><img alt="crosley-cruiser-plus-portable-turntable-red-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crosley-cruiser-plus-portable-turntable-red-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As someone who frequently indulges in the nostalgic allure of vinyl records, I was excited to give the Crosley Cruiser Plus Portable Turntable a try. The first thing I noticed was its sleek and stylish design, reminiscent of a bygone era. 

Setting it up was a breeze, and it didn't take long for me to get my favorite records spinning. The 3-speed turntable played 33 1/3, 45, and 78 RPM records seamlessly, which was a definite plus. The built-in Bluetooth feature also made it convenient to connect my mobile device for some added variety. 

The dynamic full-range stereo speakers provided an adequate listening experience, but I yearned for a deeper, richer sound overall. The Aux input was useful for blending in my own tunes, but the RCA output and headphone jack were minor conveniences that didn't significantly enhance the experience. 

Unfortunately, the pitch control feature was a bit difficult to navigate, often resulting in a jarring audio experience. I also found the small size of the turntable to be a bit limiting, especially when trying to cradle an album sleeve. 

Despite its flaws, the Crosley Cruiser Plus Portable Turntable offers a decent balance between convenience, style, and functionality for on-the-go vinyl enthusiasts. However, be prepared for a slight learning curve and a potentially underwhelming audio performance at times.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/pink-crosley-record-players?utm_source=serp.media&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=%40serpmedia&amp;utm_content=pink-crosley-record-players&amp;utm_term=crosley-voyager-turntable-stylish-portable-and-versatile"><img alt="crosley-voyager-turntable-amethyst-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crosley-voyager-turntable-amethyst-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As I unpacked the Amethyst Crosley Voyager turntable, I couldn't help but be drawn in by its vintage design. The clean, simple aesthetic was a perfect fit for my cozy living room, and I couldn't wait to start spinning my favorite records. 

I was immediately impressed by the turntable's lightweight design, which made it easy to move around the room. The built-in Bluetooth receiver was a game-changer, allowing me to stream my digital playlists directly through the stereo speakers. This was especially convenient when I had friends over for a casual gathering. 

One aspect that really stood out to me was the turntable's versatility. Whether I was spinning a 33 1/3, 45, or 78 RPM record, the Voyager handled them all with ease. The adjustable pitch control was a nice touch, letting me fine-tune the playback speed to my liking. 

However, there were a couple of drawbacks to the Amethyst Crosley Voyager turntable. Firstly, the built-in speakers were decent, but nothing to write home about. For the best sound quality, I ended up connecting the turntable to my external speakers. Secondly, the cover didn't stay closed while a record was spinning, which meant I had to be cautious when adjusting the pitch control to avoid damaging my records. 

Overall, my experience with the Amethyst Crosley Voyager turntable was mostly positive. Its vintage design and versatile playback options made it a great addition to my home, but there were a few areas where it could have performed better. Despite these minor drawbacks, I'm glad I made the purchase and can't wait to continue exploring the world of vinyl records with this trusty turntable by my side.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/pink-crosley-record-players?utm_source=serp.media&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=%40serpmedia&amp;utm_content=pink-crosley-record-players&amp;utm_term=vintage-tweed-3-speed-bluetooth-turntable-with-built-in-speakers"><img alt="crosley-cruiser-deluxe-vintage-3-speed-bluetooth-suitcase-turntable-tweed-other-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crosley-cruiser-deluxe-vintage-3-speed-bluetooth-suitcase-turntable-tweed-other-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Crosley Cruiser Deluxe suitcase turntable has served as a trusted companion throughout my musical adventures. The briefcase-style record player, constructed of wood and covered in leatherette, adds a touch of vintage charm to any living space. Equipped with adjustable pitch control and built-in stereo speakers, I can easily enjoy my vinyl collection without bothering my neighbors. 

The turntable effortlessly switches between speeds, allowing me to cater to diverse recording speeds found on various vinyl records. The high-quality Bluetooth connection enables seamless streaming of music from my smartphone directly to the turntable. 

However, the turntable does have its shortcomings. The performance of the built-in speakers is below par, making listening to music through them a less-than-ideal experience. While the portability factor and vintage appearance contribute positively, the sound quality falls short of expectations, especially when compared to more high-end, dedicated audio systems. 

As someone who appreciates both the aesthetic value and listening experience that vinyl records provide, the Crosley Cruiser Deluxe offers an attractive and compact package to enjoy music on the go.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/pink-crosley-record-players?utm_source=serp.media&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=%40serpmedia&amp;utm_content=pink-crosley-record-players&amp;utm_term=portable-suitcase-turntable-with-bluetooth-technology-and-pink-design"><img alt="victrola-bluetooth-suitcase-3-speed-turntable-pink-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/victrola-bluetooth-suitcase-3-speed-turntable-pink-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Victrola Bluetooth Suitcase, in its charming pink hue, has been an entertaining addition to my life. This little guy is chock full of features, but let's talk about the ones that stand out the most. The built-in Bluetooth technology is a game-changer; it's like having a portable party in the palm of your hand. I can blast my favorite tunes anywhere, without the hassle of tangled wires. The 3-speed turntable is another highlight - it's like having three different radios in one. 

However, there's no escaping the fact that this little record player could use some improvements. The sound quality, while decent, is not top-notch. It's hard to get the balance just right when using external speakers or headphones, and the built-in speakers are, well, less than impressive. This is a bit of a bummer for an audiophile like myself. 

One minor inconvenience that irked me a bit is the power cord situation. I found the cord that came with the player to be of the wrong type, which was quite a bother. Thankfully, I was able to find a solution, but it would've been great if the power cord was more compatible. 

In conclusion, the Victrola Bluetooth Suitcase Turntable is a unique and fun addition to my collection, but it could use some work on the sound quality and power cord compatibility. Overall, I'd give it a solid 4 out of 5 stars. It's not perfect, but it's certainly not without its charm.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/pink-crosley-record-players?utm_source=serp.media&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=%40serpmedia&amp;utm_content=pink-crosley-record-players&amp;utm_term=crosley-pink-mini-cruiser-turntable-portable-bluetooth-record-player"><img alt="crosley-mini-cruiser-turntable-tourmaline-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crosley-mini-cruiser-turntable-tourmaline-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Crosley Mini Cruiser Turntable, and I must say, the charm of this little music machine didn't disappoint. My initial thoughts were that the petite record player might be just a fun novelty—but boy was I proven wrong! This compact cutie packs a punch in features compared to its full-size counterparts. 

What stood out to me was how user-friendly and versatile the Mini Cruiser is. It's like a super-powered toy—with real functionality. The adjustable pitch control, built-in stereo speakers, and Bluetooth transmitter that connects to any Bluetooth speakers gave me options for playing my records. And the fact that it can play 3" records is quite the perk, perfect for a night of nostalgia. 

One thing I didn't like was that the Mini Cruiser only plays its teeny 3" records; full-size records and 7" records won't work here. But considering this is just a glimpse into the magic of turntables, I can say that not being all-around compatible is something I can live with. 

Overall, the Mini Cruiser has a touch of whimsy, but don't be fooled by its size; it's a record player with real capabilities and features.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/pink-crosley-record-players?utm_source=serp.media&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=%40serpmedia&amp;utm_content=pink-crosley-record-players&amp;utm_term=portable-turntable-bluetooth-speaker"><img alt="crosley-discovery-turntable-tie-dye-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/crosley-discovery-turntable-tie-dye-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Crosley Discovery Turntable has a unique tie-dye design that is quite striking, but its performance is another story entirely. I recently got my hands on one and, after some time of use, I can confidently say that this turntable is not as efficient or as reliable as I hoped it would be. 

One major downside that I discovered was the fact that the record lid doesn't fully open, making it difficult to fit even a standard 33 LP. The sound quality is another issue. While the speakers come with a built-in stereo system, the sound quality is far from impressive, with a tinny, flat sound. I also found it disappointing that the Bluetooth receiver/transmitter didn't offer a better sound quality. However, the headphone jack is a nice inclusion for private listening. 

Setting up the turntable from the box was quick and easy, but the overall build quality left a lot to be desired. The plastic feels cheap and the turntable itself is rather light. Despite the design, I found the turntable rather underwhelming. 

One of the positives worth mentioning is its portability. The case latches closed neatly and the turntable's lightweight design means it's easy to carry around. Also, the variety of record speeds adds versatility for those with different collections. 

Overall, the Crosley Discovery Turntable is a letdown, with the poor sound quality and issues with the lid detracting greatly from its aesthetic appeal. It's not what I expected and it didn't live up to my expectations.
