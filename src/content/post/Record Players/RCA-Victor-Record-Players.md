The built-in speakers were a cherry on top, as they helped deliver high-quality audio, making it an all-in-one music solution for any vinyl enthusiast. 

One of the standout features that impressed me was the Bluetooth compatibility. I was able to seamlessly connect it to my smart device and stream my favorite playlists. The 3-speed turntable was a delight to use, as I could play all my vinyl records with ease. However, I noticed that the tone arm was a bit slow to lower, which might improve over time.

Enter the Victrola Highland 4-in-1, a mid-century style beauty that seamlessly combines the old with the new. With its belt driven, 3-speed turntable, you can enjoy all your favorite vinyl records, from their classic pop to the newest indie beats.

Whether you're playing the classics or exploring new sounds, you're truly in control with this sleek record player. 

One of the best parts, besides its sound quality, is its build quality.

And the high-quality speaker system ensures you'll hear every note and lyric as it was meant to be heard. 

While the product has a lot of great points, there are a few downsides worth mentioning. Firstly, there's no built-in cartridge, which means you might need to invest in one if you don't already have one. And secondly, while the sound quality is impressive, users have commented that it might not be suitable for serious audiophiles, especially when considering the size of the speakers. 

All in all, the Victrola Highland is an excellent investment for anyone looking for a bit of old-school charm, a dash of modern technology, and a sound system that'll play all your records with panache.

If a record player lacks these connectivity options, it's best to check the model's specifications or contact the manufacturer for guidance on connectivity. 


### Is there a digital version of these record players?

No, there isn't a direct digital version of RCA Victor record players. However, some modern RCA Victor-branded turntables, such as the *RCA iP631B 3-in-1 Turntable*, come with built-in Bluetooth connectivity that allows you to connect them to speakers via a wireless connection.
