<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/l-shaped-gaming-desks?utm_source=serp.media&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=%40serpmedia&amp;utm_content=l-shaped-gaming-desks&amp;utm_term=stylish-led-gaming-desk-for-couples-with-130cm-monitor-stand"><img alt="bestier-95-l-shaped-gaming-desk-with-led-light-computer-corner-desk-or-2-person-long-table-with-shel-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/bestier-95-l-shaped-gaming-desk-with-led-light-computer-corner-desk-or-2-person-long-table-with-shel-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I had the chance to try out the Bestier 95" L Shaped Gaming Desk, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for my home office setup. The RGB light strip that comes with the desk creates a cool and immersive atmosphere while gaming. The sturdy desk with the monitor stand, headset hook, and keyboard tray offers a comfortable positioning for my screens and peripherals. 

One aspect I really appreciated was the adjustable monitor stand. It allows me to have a more ergonomic viewing experience, which has been great for my neck and back. Additionally, the included bag for the keyboard tray has been super helpful in keeping my workspace neat and organized. 

However, I do have a few concerns. The screws for mounting the monitor stands don't seem to be as secure as I'd like, and I'm constantly checking to make sure they're still in place. Another issue I faced was assembling the desk. While the instructions were clear and laid out well, the process was a bit more complicated than I anticipated. 

Overall, the Bestier 95" L Shaped Gaming Desk provides a spacious and stylish workspace, with a few minor drawbacks.

One feature that stood out to me is the adjustable leg pads, which keep the desk stable on my uneven floor. And the LED light strips, with their 20 color options and 21 dynamic modes, add a fantastic touch of atmosphere to my workspace. 

However, one thing to note is that the file cabinet can only be installed on the right side, so if you're planning to use it for that purpose, be sure to consider the overall design of your home office.

The LED lights added a cool vibe to the gaming atmosphere, and the remote control via APP made it easy to switch between the various presets. Plus, the reversible installation feature meant I could easily transform it into a long double desk whenever needed, making it perfect for gaming or working with a friend. 

However, one feature that could use some improvement is the cup holder. It often tipped over when I tried to place my drink in it, which didn't make for the smoothest gaming experience. Despite this minor setback, the overall stability and sturdiness of the desk made it a worthwhile investment.

Look for an L shaped gaming desk with an ergonomic design, including anti-glare or adjustable lighting, proper positioning for the monitor, and a keyboard tray or armrests. These features can help reduce the risk of injury and improve your overall gaming experience.
