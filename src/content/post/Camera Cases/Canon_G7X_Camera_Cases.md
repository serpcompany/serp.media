Looking back on my recent vacation, I can confidently say that investing in the Canon WP-DC55 Waterproof Case for my G7 X Mark II digital camera was one of the best decisions I've made. After a week spent exploring the depths of the ocean, diving alongside countless sea creatures, I couldn't be happier with my decision to go with this particular case for my camera. 

The first thing that stood out to me was how perfectly the case fits my G7 X Mark II. Every button and control is easily accessible and responsive, even when wearing gloves for extended dives. I was able to capture stunning videos and photos of schools of fish, sea turtles, and the ocean floor with ease. The only caveat I encountered was that the internal flash doesn't provide a lot of light for underwater photography during the day. However, using an external strobe can easily remedy this issue. 

One of the things I love most about the Canon WP-DC55 is its resilience and durability. Despite being submerged in water at depths of up to 130 feet, the case held up incredibly well, with no leaks or issues with the seals. Additionally, the clear plastic polymer construction provides excellent protection for my camera while still allowing me to see all of its beautiful imagery. 

Another feature that I greatly appreciated was the built-in diffuser, which softened the light coming from my camera's built-in flash, resulting in softer, more natural-looking underwater photos. This is a particularly helpful feature for those who want to capture the beauty of the ocean without the harshness of a direct flash. 

Overall, I would highly recommend the Canon WP-DC55 Waterproof Case to anyone looking to capture their underwater adventures in high-quality detail. While it may not be the cheapest option on the market, its durability and ease of use make it a worthwhile investment for any sea lover with a passion for photography.

The neoprene material is top-notch, providing a snug fit that securely holds my camera without adding bulk or weight. While testing it out, I didn't experience any cons, but I do wish it had a built-in strap for added convenience when walking around. 

In conclusion, I give the JJC Compact Camera Case an enthusiastic five-star rating.

## Buyer's Guide

A camera case protects your valuable Canon G7X from scratches, bumps, and weather damage. When choosing a case, consider factors such as size, style, material, and protective features. 


### Choosing the Right Size


Ensure your camera case fits snugly around your Canon G7X. Too large and it may be difficult to carry or may not offer the best protection. Too small and your camera could get damaged. Check the dimensions against your camera's specifications. 


### Selecting the Right Style

Cases come in various styles, including pouch, sleeve, and hard case designs. A pouch-style case is light and easy to carry but provides minimal protection. A sleeve case is more robust, offering better protection, while a hard case is heavier but provides the most comprehensive protection against impacts and weather. 


### Considering Material

Cases can be made from materials like nylon, leather, or polyester. Nylon is lightweight and durable, making it ideal for outdoor photography. Leather offers a classic look and feel, but it may not be as resilient. Polyester provides a balance between weight, durability, and price. 



### Assessing Protective Features

Look for features like padding, moisture resistance, and shock proofing to ensure your case provides the best possible protection for your camera. Padding helps to absorb shocks from bumps and impacts, while moisture resistance keeps your camera safe from water and humidity. 


### Additional Factors to Consider

* External pockets for accessories like extra batteries, memory cards, and lens cleaners

* Shoulder straps or wrist straps for easy carrying

* Compatibility with camera straps

* Brand reputation and customer reviews
