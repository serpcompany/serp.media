I recently purchased the Canon Waterproof Underwater Case WP-DC40 for my S60/70 camera, and it has quickly become my go-to accessory for capturing memories in various weather conditions. I've taken it snorkeling in Hawaii twice and even used it to take pictures on a family trip to the beach. The case not only protected my camera but also made it easy to take underwater shots, something I never thought I could do with such ease. 

What I love about this underwater case is its simplicity and user-friendliness. Every feature on the camera remains accessible through buttons or knobs on the housing, making it straightforward to use. Additionally, ensuring a leak-free seal is simple with just a bit of grease, providing peace of mind when using it in challenging environments. 

However, there are a few drawbacks to consider. The sunlight filtering through the water can sometimes make it difficult to see the image on the screen, causing some trial-and-error when composing shots. Plus, although not a deal-breaker, the case might benefit from an external flash for better low-light performance. 

Overall, the Canon Waterproof Underwater Case WP-DC40 has been a game-changer for my photography adventures. With its solid build and ease of use, it's allowed me to capture stunning underwater shots and worry-free pictures in rainy conditions.

I recently purchased Canon's WP-DC5 Waterproof Case for my trusty PowerShot SD700 IS digital camera. As an avid scuba diver and beach lover, I was thrilled to find a case that could help me capture some amazing underwater shots. The first thing that stood out to me was how well-built and sturdy this case is, but also easy to use. 

One of the best features of this case has got to be its ability to protect my camera from sea water and sand, making it perfect for use in marine environments. Its design allows me to shoot great underwater pictures at depths of up to 130 feet, which makes my diving trips even more enjoyable. 

However, there are some cons to note as well. While the case is easy to use, it's important to be careful with the lens port and to keep the camera open when not in use to maintain the integrity of the seals. Additionally, I've noticed that above-water drops on the port can impact shot quality, though using rain-x might potentially solve this issue. 

Overall, the Canon WP-DC5 Waterproof Case has been a game-changer in my underwater photography adventures, offering reliable protection and performance while capturing breathtaking images. If you're looking to enhance your underwater photography game, I highly recommend giving this product a try.

I recently had the pleasure of using Canon's WP-DC27 Waterproof Case for an underwater photography adventure, and I must say, it's been a reliable companion. The sleek design and easy-to-use controls make snapping photos effortless, even while submerged. However, its most impressive feature is undoubtedly its waterproof capabilities.

As someone who's been using this product in my daily life, I appreciate the thoughtful design that prioritizes both practicality and performance. The only drawback I've encountered is that the lens port isn't threaded to fit a macro or wide-angle lens, which could limit some photographic options. 

Overall, the Canon WP-DC27 Waterproof Case has been an excellent investment for my photography needs. Its durability and ease of use make it a reliable choice for any adventurer seeking high-quality underwater shots, and its versatility extends beyond the water, offering protection on land as well.

Plus, the scratch-resistant glass lens port gives me full access to my camera's zoom range without any pesky vignetting. However, despite its many positives, there's one downside: it's primarily built for video recording, so taking photos can be a little tricky without additional lighting or the help of sunlight.

I've been exploring the depths of the ocean lately with my Canon EOS M10 and its Ikelite underwater housing. The dual fiber-optic ports allowed me to connect external strobes for better underwater photography, and the built-in bulkhead is compatible with Ikelite's DS series strobes, which can be used on the housing in manual exposure mode with an optional Ikelite Fiber Optic Converter. 

A standout feature for me was the 200 ft depth rating, offering plenty of room to explore and capture images and video. The controls were responsive and allowed me to access all camera functions except for the Mobile Device Connection button, which was a minor inconvenience. 

One unique aspect of this housing is its slightly negative buoyancy in fresh water, making it easier for me to achieve that perfect shot. However, the actual buoyancy varies depending on the lens and port that I chose, so it's essential to plan accordingly. Additionally, the housing features a sturdy yet lightweight polycarbonate construction for added durability. 

My final thoughts on this Ikelite underwater housing would be that it's a great choice for capturing memories beneath the waves, with only a few minor drawbacks affecting its overall performance.

As an underwater photography enthusiast, I've been using the Nauticam Underwater Housing for my Canon EOS R5 camera for quite some time now. The first thing that struck me about this housing is its size and weight - it's quite substantial but offers great protection to my camera. 

One of the standout features is its depth rating of 100m, which has allowed me to capture some amazing underwater shots without worrying about damaging my camera. However, I did find the weight to be a bit cumbersome when carrying it around out of water. 

The port opening is another highlight of this product. Its N120 design makes it incredibly easy to change lenses, even underwater, ensuring that I don't miss any critical shots. 

On the downside, I wish the mount for the lens ports was made from metal instead of plastic, as it seems a bit flimsy and could potentially wear out over time. 

All in all, the Nauticam Underwater Housing for Canon EOS R5 has been a reliable companion on many of my underwater photography escapades, balancing robustness with ease of use.
