As a photography enthusiast, I've always been on the lookout for ways to keep my beloved Fujifilm Instax Mini 11 safe and secure. So when I came across the Frankmate Protective Case for my Instax, I was excited to give it a try. 

The first thing that caught my eye about this case was its cute bear design made from premium PU leather. It not only looks stylish but also feels sturdy in my hands, providing great protection against dust, scratches, and damages. 

One feature I really appreciated was the flip cover design. The top part of the case is detachable, meaning I don't have to remove the camera each time I want to take a picture. Plus, there's a pocket at the back of the case where I can temporarily store my shots.

However, one downside I noticed was that this case doesn't include an Instax Mini 11 Instant Film Camera, so if you're new to photography, you'll need to purchase the camera separately. 

All in all, I've had a positive experience using this product. If you're in search of a protective case for your Instax Mini 11, I'd definitely recommend giving the Frankmate Protective Case a shot.
