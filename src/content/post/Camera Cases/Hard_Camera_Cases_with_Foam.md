<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/hard-camera-cases-with-foam?utm_source=serp.media&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=%40serpmedia&amp;utm_content=hard-camera-cases-with-foam&amp;utm_term=strong-secure-apache-watertight-protective-hardcase-with-customizable-foam"><img alt="apache-watertight-protective-hardcase-with-customizable-foam-insert-9-3-17" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/apache-watertight-protective-hardcase-with-customizable-foam-insert-9-3-17/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've had the pleasure of using the Apache Watertight Protective Hardcase with Customizable Foam Insert, and I must say, it's been a game-changer. It's super sturdy, with a tough polypropylene build that can withstand just about anything I throw at it – from protecting my camera gear during adventurous shoots to safeguarding some of my more delicate tools and instruments. 

One of the things I truly appreciate about this case is how customizable the foam insert is. With the pick-and-pull system, I can easily shape the foam to fit my unique equipment, giving me that extra level of security and peace of mind. Plus, it's got an adjustable pressure relief valve that equalizes air pressure, so I can confidently open the case even after some serious altitude changes. 

However, there are some cons to consider as well. The first is that the foam isn't always as high-quality as I'd like it to be. Sometimes the cuts aren't perfect, and the foam can be a little delicate to work with. Additionally, the metal reinforcements on the locking holes seem a bit unnecessary and add extra weight to an already relatively heavy case. 

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the Apache Watertight Protective Hardcase with Customizable Foam Insert. It's durable, easy to use, and offers a high level of protection for my valuable equipment. If you're in the market for a new camera case or protective storage solution, I highly recommend giving this case a try. Just be prepared to spend a little extra time customizing the foam to your liking and dealing with the sometimes-flawed foam quality.
