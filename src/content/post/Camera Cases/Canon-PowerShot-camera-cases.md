I recently got the Canon Gadget Bag 2400 to carry my DSLR and standard lens kit. I was initially skeptical about its size, but was pleasantly surprised by how much it could fit. The bag is made from Cordura nylon, which is sturdy and lightweight, making it perfect for carrying your camera gear around. 

One of the standout features of this bag is its large zippered front accessory pocket. It's great for storing smaller items like filters and extra batteries. The inside of the bag has a mesh pocket too, offering additional storage space. The two side accessory zippered pockets are convenient as well, allowing me to keep my memory cards and cleaning cloths within easy reach.

This allowed me to securely store my DSLR and multiple lenses without any fear of them getting damaged.

However, there are a few minor drawbacks. The bag doesn't provide much padding at the bottom, so I had to be careful while placing it down to protect my camera gear. Additionally, the bag doesn't come with a rain cover, which could be an issue during wet weather conditions. 

Overall, I'm quite satisfied with the Canon Gadget Bag 2400. It's well-made, offers plenty of storage space, and is easy to carry around. While it could benefit from some additional padding and a rain cover, these are minor issues that don't detract from its overall performance.

This case fits any digital camera that measures 4.4 x 2.6 x 1.5 inches, making it compatible with most compact point-and-shoot cameras. 

The neoprene material is top-notch, providing a snug fit that securely holds my camera without adding bulk or weight. While testing it out, I didn't experience any cons, but I do wish it had a built-in strap for added convenience when walking around.
