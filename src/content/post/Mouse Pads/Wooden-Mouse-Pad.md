Nevertheless, it still offered ample space for my usual gaming maneuvers without any hassle.

This mouse pad truly stands out with its distinctive vintage wood grain pattern, bringing a touch of class to any gaming setup. The smooth surface of the mouse pad allowed for effortless gliding and accurate tracking, while the anti-slip rubber base provided a firm grip to prevent unwanted movements. 

However, the large size of this mouse pad did require me to pay attention to the available space on my desk.

Another noticeable feature was its high-quality anti-fraying stitching, which not only looked aesthetically pleasing but also added to the overall durability of the product.

It's a bit larger than the typical mouse wrist rests, so if you're looking for something compact, this might not be the best fit. But overall, I've been really happy with my purchase. It's durable, comfortable, and has a unique, sleek look that fits perfectly with my gaming setup. If you're looking for a high-quality, wooden mouse wrist rest, the Glorious Wooden Mouse Wrist Rest is definitely worth checking out.
