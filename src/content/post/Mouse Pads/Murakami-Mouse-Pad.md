### [Adorable Sakura Cat Pink Pastel Mouse Pad with Wrist Support](https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/murakami-mouse-pad?utm_source=serp.media&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=%40serpmedia&utm_content=murakami-mouse-pad&utm_term=adorable-sakura-cat-pink-pastel-mouse-pad-with-wrist-support)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/murakami-mouse-pad?utm_source=serp.media&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=%40serpmedia&amp;utm_content=murakami-mouse-pad&amp;utm_term=adorable-sakura-cat-pink-pastel-mouse-pad-with-wrist-support"><img alt="belugadesign-sakura-cat-mousepad-kawaii-desk-mat-mouse-pad-with-wrist-support-pink-pastel-large-mous-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/belugadesign-sakura-cat-mousepad-kawaii-desk-mat-mouse-pad-with-wrist-support-pink-pastel-large-mous-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've had the pleasure of using the BelugaDesign Sakura Cat Mousepad in my daily life, and it's brought a whimsical touch to my workspace. The delicate blend of pastel pinks and whites, along with the adorable anime cat featuring big eyes surrounded by cherry blossom sakura flowers is simply kawaii! 

One of the features that stood out the most for me is the large and wide size, measuring 1.3x2.5 feet or 40x77 cm. It's perfect for various setups, whether it's for work, gaming, or daily computer usage. And having a matching gel wrist support in the bundle is an added bonus for long days at the table. 

However, it does come with a caveat: the non-slip bottom is not as secure as I would have hoped, causing the mousepad to move around a bit while using. This could be a downside for some users, but overall, this Sakura Cat mousepad certainly brings a dose of joy and cuteness to my desk. 


### [Takashi Murakami x FaZe Clan Murakami Mouse Pad, Blue](https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/murakami-mouse-pad?utm_source=serp.media&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=%40serpmedia&utm_content=murakami-mouse-pad&utm_term=takashi-murakami-x-faze-clan-murakami-mouse-pad-blue)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/murakami-mouse-pad?utm_source=serp.media&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=%40serpmedia&amp;utm_content=murakami-mouse-pad&amp;utm_term=takashi-murakami-x-faze-clan-murakami-mouse-pad-blue"><img alt="takashi-murakami-x-faze-clan-large-mousepad-blue-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/takashi-murakami-x-faze-clan-large-mousepad-blue-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

Imagine sliding your mouse across a vibrant piece of art every day. That's what it feels like with the Takashi Murakami x Faze Clan Large Mousepad Blue. Standing at a sizeable 17.72 x 15.75 inches, it provides ample space for your mouse without sacrificing aesthetics. The vibrant Murakami print is eye-catching, while the FaZe Clan logo stands proudly in the corner. This unique collaboration between the renowned artist and the esports giant is a sight to behold. 

However, much like any other product, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. While the mousepad's design undeniably caught everyone's attention, some users have noticed a few drawbacks. The lower part often arrives with white spots, and its smell can be rather pungent, taking several days to dissipate. Despite these minor setbacks, users found the large mousepad to be a great addition to their gaming setup. The price tag of $50 seems reasonable for such a unique and functional item. All in all, it's a fun and practical tool for gamers, though not without its flaws.

The size may vary, but it's definitely enough to protect your desk from those accidental spills.

As an office worker who spends most of my day typing on my computer, I'm always on the lookout for a reliable mouse pad that can withstand the wear and tear of daily use. That's why I was excited to try out the Shinsuke Takasugi Large Mouse Pad featuring the iconic "Gintama" design. 

The moment I unboxed it, I was instantly drawn to its vibrant colors and eye-catching illustration. But beyond its aesthetics, the mouse pad performed exceptionally well in terms of functionality. The surface was smooth enough to provide accurate and precise tracking, while the texture was just right to offer enough friction to keep my mouse in place during intense gaming sessions. 

However, there were a few small drawbacks. Despite its large size, the mouse pad didn't seem to be as durable as some of the more expensive options on the market. Additionally, since this mouse pad is a unique collaboration between Shinsuke Takasugi and "Gintama, " it might not be the best choice for users who aren't fans of the popular anime series. 

Overall, the Shinsuke Takasugi Large Mouse Pad "Gintama" proved to be a solid choice for gamers and office workers alike who appreciate a blend of style and performance in their office gear.
