<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/white-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serp.media&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=%40serpmedia&amp;utm_content=white-gaming-mouse-pads&amp;utm_term=xl-gaming-mouse-pad-with-unique-speed-and-control"><img alt="glorious-pc-gaming-race-mouse-pad-white-xl-slim-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/glorious-pc-gaming-race-mouse-pad-white-xl-slim-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on Glorious' XL Slim mousepad and have been using it every day since then. The white color fits perfectly with my setup and the large surface area gives me plenty of room to maneuver my mouse. 

The most noticeable aspect of this mousepad is the stitched edges, ensuring the edges do not fray and the pad maintains its shape. It's definitely a plus for the aesthetics, giving the pad a luxurious look. However, the most impressive feature is the surface. It provides an ideal blend of speed and control, making it perfect for any game scenario, from precision aiming in a first-person shooter to fast-paced strategic maneuvers. 

Unfortunately, in my daily use, I've discovered that the non-slip rubber base doesn't seem to hold up as well as I hoped. Although it's not a deal-breaker, I've noticed the pad occasionally slides around my desk, which can be a minor inconvenience. 

On the plus side, the pad is machine washable, which is a huge plus for those who need a quick clean-up. However, I had to be a bit cautious with this as the first wash resulted in some color loss, turning the pad a bit grey instead of the white shade I initially enjoyed. 

The price-point is reasonable for what you get, it's more of a premium product since it comes from Glorious. Overall, if you're in the market for a large-sized, smooth gliding mouse pad that can handle high-speed gaming action, then this Glorious product is worth checking out. Just remember to consider the potential for color loss with the first wash!

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/white-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serp.media&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=%40serpmedia&amp;utm_content=white-gaming-mouse-pads&amp;utm_term=glorious-xl-extended-gaming-mouse-pad-with-non-slip-base"><img alt="glorious-pc-gaming-race-mouse-pad-white-xl-extended-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/glorious-pc-gaming-race-mouse-pad-white-xl-extended-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who's been using the Glorious PC Gaming Race mouse pad for a while, I can confidently say it's become an essential part of my daily gaming setups. The XL Extended edition, in particular, has made a huge difference in my gameplay experience. 

One of the standout features of this mouse pad is its immense surface area. It's almost like a speed pad, allowing for quick and precise movement, which is perfect for me as I play in low sensitivity. Plus, the anti-slip coating on the back ensures that it stays firmly in place on my desk, even when I'm really getting into the action. 

However, it's not all rosy. I've noticed that the edges of the pad can be a bit harsh on the wrist, especially after extended gaming sessions. And while the pad itself is easy to clean, the material is susceptible to staining. It's a minor inconvenience, but something to bear in mind. 

All in all, the Glorious PC Gaming Race mouse pad has been a great addition to my gaming setup. It provides excellent control and movement, but has a couple of minor drawbacks. For the price, it's definitely worth considering.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/white-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serp.media&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=%40serpmedia&amp;utm_content=white-gaming-mouse-pads&amp;utm_term=glorious-race-gaming-mouse-pad-large-high-quality"><img alt="glorious-pc-gaming-race-mouse-pad-white-large-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/glorious-pc-gaming-race-mouse-pad-white-large-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Glorious PC Gaming Race Mouse Pad White Large has been impressive in my daily gaming life. I love the large white gaming surface – perfect for wide turning circles and FPS titles. The anti-slip rubber base keeps the pad firmly in place during intense gaming battles, making it a reliable choice for both casual and hardcore gamers. 

One thing that has stood out in my experience is the durability of the pad. The stitched edges prevent damage and fraying, ensuring the pad remains in pristine condition for a long time. The sleek space-saving design with a smooth fabric surface is perfect for fitting onto any desk. 

I must admit, I had my doubts about the plastic feel but the pad holds up well in practice. The smooth, slightly rectangular shape with two-millimeter height offers a great balance of accuracy and speed for mouse movements. 

Using this mouse pad has been an absolute pleasure. However, there is one thing that could make it even better - more customizable lighting options would be a welcome addition. Overall, the Glorious PC Gaming Race Mouse Pad White Large is an excellent addition to any gaming setup.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/white-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serp.media&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=%40serpmedia&amp;utm_content=white-gaming-mouse-pads&amp;utm_term=glorious-race-extended-white-gaming-mouse-pad"><img alt="glorious-pc-gaming-race-mouse-pad-white-extended-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/glorious-pc-gaming-race-mouse-pad-white-extended-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I first received the Glorious White Extended mouse pad, I was eager to try it out in my daily gaming sessions. The mat arrived in perfect condition, neatly packaged with no signs of wear or damage. I immediately noticed the generous size of the mat, providing ample space for both my mechanical keyboard and mouse without taking up too much desk space. 

The non-slip rubber base was a great feature that kept my mouse pad firmly anchored on my desk, ensuring precision and control during intense gaming sessions. The mat's unique surface offered a perfect blend of speed and control, making it ideal for a variety of gaming scenarios – from precise headshots in first-person shooters to intricate strategy in the world of RPGs. 

One downside I encountered was the mat's stains and smudges were quite evident. It seemed like the advertised white color was more of a "greyish-white" or "blueish-grey", which didn't quite blend well with my overall white gaming setup. However, this did not impact the overall performance of the mat itself, as the Glorious White Extended proved to be a reliable, high-quality tool for ensuring accurate results in all my gaming sessions. 

In conclusion, although the advertised white color was slightly misleading, the Glorious White Extended mouse pad offers excellent features and reliable performance. For those seeking a comfortable, spacious, and non-slip mat for their gaming setup, this product is definitely worth considering.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/white-gaming-mouse-pads?utm_source=serp.media&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=%40serpmedia&amp;utm_content=white-gaming-mouse-pads&amp;utm_term=ultra-slim-white-gaming-mouse-pad-with-non-slip-base"><img alt="aci-premium-series-ultra-thin-mouse-pad-white-1-count-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/aci-premium-series-ultra-thin-mouse-pad-white-1-count-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've recently had the chance to try out the ACI Premium Series Ultra Thin Mouse Pad, and let me tell you, it's made a significant improvement in my gaming sessions and everyday computer usage. The smooth PVC tracking surface is a game-changer, providing high precision and ensuring a gliding experience even with the most sensitive mouse movements. I also love the non-skid natural rubber base that keeps the mat in place, avoiding those awkward mishaps when your mouse pad decides to take a stroll across the desk. 

However, it's not all smooth sailing. The thickness of the mouse pad might be a bit of a drawback for some, as it doesn't quite feel as hard as I would have preferred. It's more of a flexible surface, which might not be everyone's cup of tea. On the positive side, the mat is incredibly soft and comfortable to the touch, so it still manages to create an enjoyable computer experience. 

Overall, the ACI Premium Series Ultra Thin Mouse Pad is a great choice for gamers and professionals alike, offering both high precision tracking and an anti-slip guarantee. Its eye-catching high definition print adds a splash of color to your workspace, and the ultra-soft feel is a bonus. Although the hard surface thickness is not as rigid as I expected, it compensates with its softness and non-skid base.

Using this mouse pad daily, I noticed how smoothly the mouse glides over it, providing a better gaming experience and reducing the strain on my hand. The design not only looks great but also adds an elegant touch to my desk setup. However, one thing I noticed was that it isn't too thick, which might be a pro or con depending on personal preference.

### Size and Surface Type

The size of the mouse pad and the type of surface it has can greatly affect your gaming experience. Consider the size of your gaming desk and the space you have available.
