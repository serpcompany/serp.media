Despite the smoothness, the mouse pad has managed to maintain a non-slip grip on my desk, preventing any disruption in my work or games. The water-resistant coating has been particularly useful – despite the occasional spillage, such as water, coffee, or juice, the mat can be easily cleaned without any delay.

I recently tried out this Black and White Cherry Blossom XXL Mouse Pad, and I must say, it's a game-changer for both work and play. The XXL size is perfect for fitting my mouse, keyboard, and other desk essentials, making my workspace feel more organized and efficient. And, the non-slip rubber base is a lifesaver – no more annoying mouse pad movement while I'm deep into a gaming session or focused on my work. 

One feature that really stood out to me is the waterproof coating. Accidents happen, and it's always nice to know that my mouse pad can handle spills without getting damaged. Plus, it's easy to clean – a simple wipe with a wet cloth and it's as good as new. 

However, there are a couple of downsides that I noticed. Despite its durability, it does weigh quite a bit, which can be a hassle to move around. Additionally, while the stitched edges look neat, they can be a bit of a pain to clean when there are any spills near them. 

Overall, I'm happy with my experience using this Extended Gaming Mouse Pad. It's comfortable, durable, and provides the perfect blend of speed and control for both gaming and office work. While there are a few minor drawbacks, the benefits definitely outweigh them.

I was searching for a gaming mouse pad that could accommodate my large mouse, and the Black White Striped Gaming Mouse Pad XL from Wallacely seemed like a perfect fit. The size of 31.5 x 11.8 inches really impressed me, and the non-slip rubber base ensured a secure hold for my gaming sessions. 

This mouse pad is not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing, with its black and white striped design. But what really made a difference for me were the stitched edges that provided that extra durability I was seeking. The 6mm lockrand and 3mm thickness perfectly suited my needs, offering a seamless gliding surface for my mouse. 

However, while I absolutely love the design, I did find the mouse pad a bit too large for my work setup, and sometimes, my mouse would accidentally slip off the edges. Despite this minor inconvenience, the Black White Striped Gaming Mouse Pad XL from Wallacely has become a staple in my gaming and work setup, providing a high-quality user experience.

The size of the pad is perfect, covering my entire desk and allowing me to place my laptop, mouse, and keyboard without any trouble.

One of the highlights of this mouse pad is the water-resistant coating, which protects against accidental spills and keeps the surface clean. And let's not forget the adorable Cherry Blossom design – it's a beautiful addition to my workspace. The non-slip rubber base also makes sure the pad stays in place, so I don't have to worry about constantly adjusting it. However, one thing to note is that the pad is a bit thicker than what I'm used to, but it's actually quite comfortable for my wrist. 

Overall, I'm really happy with my Cherry Blossom mouse pad. It's both functional and stylish, and has made my workday a little more enjoyable. I highly recommend giving this mouse pad a try if you're looking for a high-quality, comfortable option for your desk.
