<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/parabolic-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=parabolic-microphones&utm_term=klover-mik-09-parabolic-dish-for-lavalier-microphones-1"><img alt="klover-mik-09-parabolic-dish-for-lavalier-microphones-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/klover-mik-09-parabolic-dish-for-lavalier-microphones-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

The Klover MIK 09 Parabolic Dish has been quite an interesting addition to my filming gear. I've been a fan of shotgun mics for their directionality and precision, but let's face it - they're not the most unobtrusive option, especially for those candid moments. That's where this parabolic dish comes into play. It allows me to use my trusty lav mic as a makeshift shotgun, giving me that same directionality but in a much smaller package. This is especially useful if I'm working on a tight shoot or capturing close-ups where a larger, more visible microphone wouldn't do. 

One thing I really like about this dish is its range. It's designed to capture sound from 30 to 50 feet away, which means I can keep my subject at a comfortable distance without worrying about losing audio quality. The dish's size, though, can be a bit of a trade-off. At about 9 inches in diameter, it's definitely not the most compact option, but its performance makes up for its size. 

However, one thing I wasn't too thrilled about was the price tag. As much as I appreciate the unique purpose this dish serves, I do think that the $375 price point is quite steep, especially since the microphone isn't included. For comparison, you can easily find decentshotgun mics at that price range. 

All in all, the Klover MIK 09 Parabolic Dish is an interesting and niche product. It's definitely not for everyone, but if you're looking for a way to use your lav mic as a shotgun without spending a fortune on an actual shotgun microphone, this could be worth considering.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/parabolic-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=parabolic-microphones&utm_term=universal-audio-sphere-dlx-modeling-microphone-1"><img alt="universal-audio-sphere-dlx-modeling-microphone-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/universal-audio-sphere-dlx-modeling-microphone-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I recently got my hands on the Universal Audio Sphere DLX Modeling Microphone, a device that promises to revolutionize my home recording setup. I'll be honest, at first, I was skeptical about the idea of a microphone that can emulate the sound of some of the most legendary mics in history. But after using it for a few weeks, I'm a total convert. 

The Sphere DLX is built on the design of its predecessor, the Sphere LX, but it takes things to the next level with its modeling technology. It's amazing how this single microphone can give you the sound of 38 different classic mics. And the best part? You can switch between these models in real-time while you're recording! 

One feature that really stood out for me is the dual-output polar pattern. This allows me to record stereo sound sources like strings, horns, and more with just the Sphere DLX. This is particularly useful when I'm recording live performances or working with a full band. 

The Sphere DLX also has a neat trick up its sleeve: the ability to change mic type, polar pattern, and more even after you've finished recording. This means I can experiment with different sounds without having to re-record anything, which is a huge time-saver. 

I also appreciate the low noise level that the Sphere DLX delivers. The dual gold-sputtered diaphragms ensure that I get the best possible audio fidelity, even when working with dynamic sources like guitar cabs or snare drums. 

Finally, the inclusion of IsoSphere and the premium-quality accessories that come with the microphone make it easy to set up and use right out of the box. 

However, there is one downside that I've noticed. The Sphere DLX is quite sensitive, and it can pick up subtle ambient noises. While this can be a positive trait in some situations, it can be a bit of a pain in others, like when I'm recording in a noisy environment. 

But overall, I'm extremely impressed with the Universal Audio Sphere DLX Modeling Microphone. It's a versatile and powerful tool that has transformed my home recording setup. If you're a musician or a podcaster looking to up your recording game, I highly recommend giving the Sphere DLX a try.

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/parabolic-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=parabolic-microphones&utm_term=earthworks-fw730-7-flexwand-microphone-1"><img alt="earthworks-fw730-7-flexwand-microphone-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/earthworks-fw730-7-flexwand-microphone-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a reviewer who has been using the Earthworks FW730 7' FlexWand Microphone, I've discovered that it truly is an exceptional piece of equipment. The FlexWand's combined microphone and stand system is a game-changer, offering a sleek, clean look and superb sound quality in one package. The microphone's ability to be positioned as high as 7 feet or as low as 1.5 feet makes it incredibly versatile and perfect for choirs and vocal groups. 

One feature that I particularly love is the near-perfect polar response, which allows for fantastic rejection of sounds from the rear of the microphone. This is ideal for scenarios where bands or orchestras are situated in front of a choir, as the FW730 can effectively filter out unwanted noises. The sturdy 12 pound cast iron base also ensures that the microphone remains securely in place, even during lively performances. 

On the downside, the FW730 is a significant investment, which might not be within reach for all musicians. Additionally, the high-quality construction and advanced features mean that it takes some time to fully understand and utilize the microphone's capabilities to their fullest extent. 

In summary, the Earthworks FW730 7' FlexWand Microphone is a remarkable microphone system that offers top-notch performance and unmatched versatility. While it may be a pricier option, the benefits, including the near-perfect polar response and adjustable height, make it a worthy investment for serious musicians and performers.

In my quest for a better audio recording experience, I stumbled upon the Klover MIK 09 Parabolic Collector Mounts KM-09-ACC. . I have to say, the 8-inch parabolic dish is quite remarkable and amplifies sound up to 6 times. . 

It's a solid alternative to traditional shotgun microphones and works well with Omnidirectional lapel mics up to 5/16 inch in diameter. . However, it's disappointing that it only comes with a dish and no microphone. . 

The mounting bracket is versatile and can hold flash shoe accessories like compact LED lights, but the hot shoe mount or magic arm is sold separately. . The mounting rod is another useful feature for connecting shotgun mics. . Overall, I'm happy with the parabolic dish's performance, but the lack of a microphone included in the package left me a bit disheartened. . 


### [High-Definition Measurement Microphone](https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/parabolic-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=parabolic-microphones&utm_term=high-definition-measurement-microphone)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/@serpmedia/amazon/parabolic-microphones?utm_source=serpmedia&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=serp.media&utm_content=parabolic-microphones&utm_term=earthworks-m23-omnidirectional-measurement-microphone-1"><img alt="earthworks-m23-omnidirectional-measurement-microphone-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/earthworks-m23-omnidirectional-measurement-microphone-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've had the chance to use the Earthworks M23 Omnidirectional High Definition Measurement Microphone for sound system alignment and calibration, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer. With an impressive 138 dB SPL rating, this microphone definitely stands out in reducing distortion while recording audios. Its unique polar pattern ensures efficiency in performance, while the frequency response up to 23 kHz captures crisp sounds. 

One thing that truly impressed me was how the microphone maintains its sensitivity despite variations in ambient temperature, thanks to its exclusive circuitry. It meets or exceeds ANSI Type 1 requirements, which speaks volumes about its accuracy in free-field measurements. 

In terms of usage, the Earthworks M23 is incredibly user-friendly. You simply connect it to a microphone preamplifier supplying 48V phantom power using a standard XLR cable. Allow some time for the microphone to settle, and point it toward the sound source for optimum results. 

However, I must admit that I was slightly disappointed when the manufacturer's. frd calibration file was not included in the cost. Other than that, I couldn't ask for a better tool in acoustical measurements and system setup.
